The controls are :
Z/S : move forward / backward
Q/D : rotate to left / right
Mouse : rotate the camera around

What I have done :
I succesfully made the player controller and made the several foes move.

I made the entities go back on terrain in case they would fall.

I made a camera that the player can control with the mouse.

What I tried :
I tried to generate randomly a terrain and smooth it through Beziers curves or other formulas, but couldn't

I tried to make the shells fired goes forward the firing direction, but It seems they would not move an inch.

What I could not do :
I could not make an UI to display the health of the player.

I didn't finished the game.
